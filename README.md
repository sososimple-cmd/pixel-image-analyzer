# üì∏ Pixel Learning Co. - Automated Image Classification with AWS Rekognition

This project simulates a workflow for a fictional company, **Pixel Learning Co.**, where images uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically classified using **AWS Rekognition**. The classification results are stored in **DynamoDB**, with metadata tracked using a **Lambda function**. A **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline deploys infrastructure and code.

## üöÄ Project Features

- Upload an image to S3 ‚Üí triggers Lambda
- Lambda classifies image using AWS Rekognition
- Results logged into a corresponding DynamoDB table
- GitHub Actions automates the deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Resources Setup

### 1. ‚úÖ S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket for image uploads:

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket pixel-image-uploads --region us-east-1
Enable event notification for new object creation to trigger Lambda:

Go to S3 > your bucket > Properties > Event notifications > Add event.

Name it TriggerLambda, event type: PUT, destination: your Lambda function.

## 2. üîç AWS Rekognition
No setup needed ‚Äî Rekognition is ready to use out of the box. The Lambda function will use the detect_labels API.

Make sure your IAM role has this permission:
```bash
"rekognition:DetectLabels"
```

## 3. üóÉÔ∏è DynamoDB Tables
You need two DynamoDB tables (or just one depending on your structure).

Create via AWS CLI or Console:

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name ImageMetadata \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=imageKey,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=imageKey,KeyType=HASH \
  --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

üîê GitHub Secrets Configuration
In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following:

```bash
| Secret Name             | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Your AWS access key with deploy permissions   |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret key                           |
| `AWS_REGION`            | Region of your AWS services (e.g., us-east-1) |
```

## 4. üîÅ Adding & Analyzing New Images
Go to your S3 bucket.

Click ‚ÄúUpload,‚Äù and upload any .jpg or .png image.

Once uploaded:

Lambda will trigger automatically.

Rekognition will analyze the image.

Metadata will be logged to DynamoDB

üß† Example DynamoDB Record
```bash
{
  "imageKey": "beta_dogs.jpg",
  "labels": ["Dog", "Pet", "Animal"],
  "bucketName": "pixel-image-uploads",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T13:42:00Z"
}
```

üß™ Testing Locally
You can test the Lambda using the AWS Console by simulating a test event.

Use an S3 ObjectCreated:Put event as the sample.

Once everything is set up, you‚Äôll have a fully automated image classification pipeline running in the cloud ‚Äî no manual steps, no guessing. Just upload an image and let AWS handle the rest. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn cloud automation, serverless architecture, or how to integrate security workflows into real-world scenarios.
